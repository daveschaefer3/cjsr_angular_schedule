cjsr_angular_schedule
=====================

A project for converting the online schedule for CJSR 88.5FM, Alberta, Canada's first campus radio station, to the AngularJS framework.

This project will convert https://github.com/daveschaefer3/cjsr_schedule to an AngularJS project.

The original project converts json data into a schedule of shows that air each week using custom javascript functions, Handlebars string templates, Less.js and Twitter Bootstrap.

The angular version of the project will require Angular templates instead of Handlebars templates, SCSS styling rather than Less.js and, of course, a restructuring of javascript using Angular's opinionated MVC framework.

Future features will hopefully include:

 - a responsive design for mobile and widescreen browsers
 - a back-end for administration (CRUD functions) using MongoDB and node.js
 - various tooltips and widgets (what's on now, genre legend), twitter integration/handles

Please get in touch if you see any problems and would like to help!
